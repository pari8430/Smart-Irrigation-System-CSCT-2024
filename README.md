## Project Overview

This project presents an **IoT-enabled smart irrigation system** that automates water distribution by integrating soil moisture sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, and cloud communication for real-time data processing. The system uses **AI/ML-driven automated decision-making** to optimize water usage based on environmental conditions, reducing manual intervention and improving irrigation efficiency.
